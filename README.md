=================

Our EC2 instance is configured. To run the app in the project directory run `meteor` and point your browser to the instance ip at port 3000. For the windows users it should be easier just to develop directly on the EC2 but download instructions are below. 

Download meteor 
`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`
Install Node
Install Meteorite
`npm install -g meteorite`

To get the application running on your local computer 

Clone/pull repository
`sudo mrt install`
